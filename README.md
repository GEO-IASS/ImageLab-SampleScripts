# ImageLab-SampleScripts written in ILabPascal

[Epina ImageLab](http://imagelab.at/) is a Windows-based multisensor imaging system for processing and analyzing hyperspectral images. It is a modular system consisting of a basic engine, a graphical user interface, and optional user-supplied modules. It supports all major spectroscopic imaging techniques, such as uv/vis, infrared, Raman, THz, optical emission and absorption, EDX (energy dispersive xray), and mass spectrometry.

Though [ImageLab](http://imagelab.at/) is closed source it provides a scripting engine which enables the user to automatically perform many aspects of image processing. Many features of the graphical user interface can be executed by scripted commands as well. The [ImageLab](http://imagelab.at/) script language ([ILabPascal](http://www.imagelab.at/help/ilab_scripts.htm)) is basically a [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) dialect, which has been augmented by many commands specifically tailored to image analysis.

The ILabPascal compiler is only available for the [Extended Edition](http://imagelab.at/en_purchase.html). A [Free 30-Day License](http://imagelab.at/en_free_license.html) can be requested under <http://imagelab.at/en_free_license.html>.
